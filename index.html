						<h2>The BitCrystals Token Sale</h2>

							<div class="col-md-6">
								<p style="text-align: justify;">The BitCrystals Token Sale is a crowdfund to support the development of Spells of Genesis. When you buy BitCrystals, you become a backer of the project. This means you get rewarded with the game’s premium currency while funding its development. You can then use your BitCrystals to purchase new card decks and game items or trade them online.</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">To be initially offered at the rate of 15,000 BitCrystals per BTC, the price will increase every 5 days. The Token Sale ends after 30 days or when all the BitCrystals are sold, whichever occurs first. Unsold BitCrystals will be burned.</p>

												<p>As an extra guarantee to our contributors we want to receive funds raised during our token sale ONLY if we deliver Spells of Genesis and its features as planned. All the funds raised will be held in a multisig wallet.</p>

												<p>The key officers are:</p>

												<p><i>Erik Voorhees</i> is among the top-recognized serial Bitcoin advocates and entrepreneurs, understanding Bitcoin as one of the most important inventions ever created by humanity.<br>

												Having been a featured guest on Bloomberg, Fox Business, CNBC, BBC Radio, The Peter Schiff Show, and numerous Bitcoin and industry conferences, Erik humbly suggests that there is no such thing
												as a “free market” when the institution of money itself is centrally planned and controlled.</p>

												<p><i>Jeremy Johnson</i> is a big believer in blockchain technologies and the founder and lead developer of CoinDaddy.io. He also wrote the counterpartychain.io and dogepartychain.io blockchain viewers and free APIs. CoinDaddy is a crypto 2.0 services company that makes blockchain technologies easier to understand for users to grasp their power, while providing tools for them to use today and benefit their lives.</p>

												<p>Funds will be released by the officers ONLY on satisfactory completion of each of the four milestones.</p>

												<p>EverdreamSoft will be collecting funds during the token sale to support and further the development of Spells of Genesis as well as future ideas. It is important to realize that Bitcoin valuation fluctuates continuously and EverdreamSoft has a well thought out hedging plan. During the token sale we will be liquidating portions of the incoming Bitcoin into FIAT currency.</p>

												<p>EverdreamSoft liabilities (mostly paying developers, illustrators, and team members) will be primarily denominated in USD and BTC. We will convert up to 70% BTC to USD during the token sale. All USD assets will be held in a multi signature account (by the same key officers) until the milestones are reached and funds are released.</p>

												<p><strong>How do I purchase BitCrystals?</strong></p>
												<p>We are partnering with ShapeShift for the BitCrystals Token Sale, this will allow our contributors to use BTC and over 40 supported altcoins. BitCrystals are a Counterparty asset, at the time of purchase you will have the option to submit a Counterparty compatible address, like <a href="https://counterwallet.io" target="_blank">Counterwallet</a>. This is necessary for us to send you BitCrystals after the sale end.</p>

												<p>Submitting a Counterwallet address is optional at the time of purchase, if you don’t have one, or don’t know how to get one, don’t worry, we will release instructions by the end of the token sale. We will email everyone who has not provided a Counterwallet address when ordering, at the email provided, requesting a distribution address. You can browse through our FAQ for more info on how to create a Counterwallet, however we will also provide our own easy way to store and use BitCrystals in the very near future, stay tuned.</p>

												<p><strong>Purchasing BitCrystals with Altcoins</strong></p>
												<p>If you intend purchasing BitCrystals with altcoins supported by ShapeShift be aware that you will have a 10 minute window to complete your order. Please pay close attention to this because if, for instance, you are sending coins from Counterwallet, the time frame may not be sufficient for your transaction to complete. In such an event, our friends at ShapeShift will be there to help you with their support team. Take note of the transaction ID for the payment in your wallet and send an email to ShapeShift directly at <a href="mailto:support@shapeshift.zendesk.com">support@shapeshift.zendesk.com</a>. 

												<p>However, we recommend using Counterparty compatible wallets which process transactions much faster than Counterwallet like:
												<ul class="list-unstyled">
												<li><i class="fa fa-caret-right pr-10 text-colored"></i> CW Indie available for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=inc.lireneosoft.counterparty" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/counterwallet/id977972108?l=en&mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>.</li>
												<li><i class="fa fa-caret-right pr-10 text-colored"></i> <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tokenly-pockets/pdkmidhbflcbhddoagiikmafccadidhh?hl=en-US" target="_blank">Tokenly Pockets</a> for Google Chrome.</li>
												<li><i class="fa fa-caret-right pr-10 text-colored"></i> <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ltb-companion-wallet/jmjmgcgkbndiepapjbcabhdbbhmmkhmj?hl=en-US" target="_blank">LTB Companion Wallet</a> for Google Chrome.</li>
												</ul></p>

												<p>Also keep in mind that when purchasing with certain, more popular, altcoins there will be a limit of about 4 BTC worth per order. When submitting your order if you have entered an invalid amount you will get a warning and you will have to enter a new value. You can buy as many BTC worth of BitCrystals as you wish with altcoins, but you will have to submit multiple orders if they exceed a certain threshold.<p>

												<p><strong>Purchasing BitCrystals with Bitcoin</strong></p>
												<p>If you intend purchasing BitCrystals with Bitcoin you can send your contribution from literally any wallet. There are no limitations in the amount of BTC you can contribute to the token sale, even in a single order. Furthermore, there is not a 10 minute time limit to complete your transaction, once you send BTC they will be processed as soon as they are confirmed, however long it takes.</p>

												<p><strong>To Sum It Up</strong></p>
												<p>You can send any amount of BTC from any wallet with no time limit to complete transactions. We suggest to avoid using Counterwallet to purchase BitCrystals with altcoins because your transaction may take longer than 10 minutes to complete, alternatively, use the recommended wallets mentioned above.<p>

												<p><strong>When will token sale contributors receive BitCrystals?</strong></p>
												<p>BitCrystals will be distributed within two weeks after the end of the token sale. It may happen within a few days or it may take longer, depending on the amount of contributors. We will do our best to deliver as soon as feasibly possible.</p>

												<p><strong>When will eligible token sale contributors receive SATOSHICARD and GENESISCARD?</strong></p>
												<p>SATOSHICARD and GENESISCARD will be distributed within one week after the end of the token sale. We will do our best to deliver as soon as feasibly possible.</p>

												<p><strong>What if only little funds get raised during the Token Sale?</strong></p>
												<p>For a fully featured game as per milestone #4 we estimate the cost to be around $200,000 US. We will keep developing Spells of Genesis as much as we can with the funds that are raised, however much that is. If we raise very little completion of the milestones may take longer than expected and we will have to review them or get the community to vote for priorities.</p>

												<p><strong>What payment methods will be accepted for the Token Sale?</strong></p>
												<p>Bitcoin and thanks to Shapeshift, any altcoin accepted on their platform.</p>

												<p><strong>How do the key officers know when to release the funds?</strong></p>
												<p>When EDS believes that one of the milestones has been completed the key officers will have to test each claimed feature of the game and make sure they are happy with the results before releasing the funds.</p>

								<h3 id="footer-content" class="title text-center">MISSION</h1>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">Our motivation in developing SoG stems from our desire to create a game in strong cooperation with the community. With <a href="http://www.moonga.com/?ref=bctpd" target="_blank">Moonga</a>, our main trading card game, we were among the first to have a free-to-play game on the AppStore in 2009. Since then, the genre has evolved in unexpected ways.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We saw some of our players trading rare cards for more than 1000 USD, even if it was not allowed by the terms of service. A whole economy emerged in the game. This inspired us to conceptualise how we could go beyond that and leverage digital goods ownership.</p>

								<h3 id="footer-content" class="title text-center">VISION</h1>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">Our goal. is to build an innovative in-game economy while developing the whole game economy and background story, cryptocurrency will be used as an in-game means of exchange. Counterparty tokens will be assigned to cards in SoG which means you can trade cards freely within and outside the game app.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Players will own their game items and cards not only in the game world but also on the bitcoin blockchain. Other functions on Counterparty such as the lock feature will also give players the possibility to lock a specific amount of rare cards in a public and transparent manner.</p>

						<div class="col-sm-4">
							<div class="footer-content">
								<h3 id="footer-content" class="title text-center">APPROACH</h1>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">BitCrystals are digital assets acting as both the game-fuel and the premium in-game currency. There is a limited supply of BitCrystals which can be used (burned) to create new card packs or traded with other players in Spells of Genesis.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> You will be able to trade cards and game items easily within and outside the SoG game app. This is made possible through Counterparty, a platform which can be used for creating custom tokens which act as their own cryptocurrency, while still running on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
